# ClassGenerator
This application will generate an entire Java class with a parameterized constructor, getter methods, setter methods, and a generic toString method as well. 
To specify what classes you would like to generate, enter the information in the included .csv file. There are examples in the file of how you should specify
the class name and instance fields. You may specify as many classes as you like and you may specify as many instance fields for each class as you like.
